This repository contains programs to demonstrate abilities in software coding. Unless otherwise stated individual files are unrelated and not part of a broader project. 
The programs demonstrate: 
- multithreading & parallel programming
- database structure algorithms (breadth-first search, depth-first search)
- Dijkstra's shortest reach algorithm 
- efficient methods for finding prime numbers
- file processing
